Project: YouTube Clip Downloader Web App

Summary of our conversation so you can pick up where we left off.

1.  **Initial Goal:**
    *   Create a simple web application using Node.js and Express to download YouTube video clips.

2.  **Technical Problem:**
    *   We discovered that the common Node.js library for this (`ytdl-core`) is often broken due to YouTube's updates.

3.  **The Solution:**
    *   Instead of a library, we decided to use a more robust command-line tool called `yt-dlp`. The Node.js app will run this tool in the background. This is a much more stable approach.

4.  **Hosting Plan:**
    *   We initially discussed hosting on Namecheap, but their shared hosting plans do not allow installing custom tools like `yt-dlp`.
    *   We have decided to use **Google Cloud Platform** instead, as it's more flexible and has a generous free tier.

5.  **Current Plan & Next Steps:**
    *   **Platform:** Google Cloud Run (a serverless service).
    *   **Cost:** Should be $0 by using the free tier.
    *   **My immediate task:** I will now start building the Node.js/Express application and create a `Dockerfile` for it.
    *   **Your next step (after I'm done):** I will guide you on how to deploy the application to your Google Cloud account.

When you're back, just let me know you're ready to continue, and I'll start building the app.
